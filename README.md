# FPM_benchmarks

The repository provides MATLAB codes for 6 Fourier ptychographic microscopy (FPM) reconstruction algorithms for testing their performance. 
Run "gen_img_batch.m" to generate the simulated FPM data. 
One can add noise signals and LED shifting during the generation of FPM data, to simulate the comment challenges in FPM experiments.
